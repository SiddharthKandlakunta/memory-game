## ***Reflections***
**Reflection on the Design and Development of MemoRune Memory Game**

<div align="justify"> The creation of the MemoRune Memory Game was an exciting journey that involved various design and development challenges, as well as moments of success. The objective of the game was to present players with a fun and educational memory challenge using runic symbols. In this reflection, We will discuss the design and development process, challenges encountered, what worked well, what didn't, and the valuable lessons learned along the way. </div>  
<br/>

**Game Design**

<div align="justify"> The initial design phase was crucial for outlining the game's objectives, features, and overall user experience. We wanted MemoRune to be intuitive, engaging, and visually appealing. The decision to use runic symbols as the game's theme was an interesting choice as we wanted to do a viking themed game, adding cultural and historical depth to the experience. We wanted to add more depth to the classic Memory game so we decided to add modes to the game. The four different game modes—Freeplay, VS, Countdown, and Sprint—offered a variety of challenges to cater to different player preferences, making the game more versatile and appealing. </div>  
<br/>


**Development Challenges**

<div align="justify"> One of the primary challenges during development was ensuring that the game functioned flawlessly in both design and functionality. Matching runic symbols required careful implementation to ensure a seamless and enjoyable user experience. At first we thought about addiding different jpegs as images for our runes, this turned out to be hard because we decided to do multiple grid sizes. So, we went for svg images, where we could change the color of the runes in code, which made it easier for us as we did not have to search for different jpegs for each grid size. We encountered difficulties in managing the various game modes, especially in synchronizing the timer across the different modes. Debugging and testing became a crucial part of the development process, as it was essential to catch and fix any issues that might disrupt the gameplay. </div>  
<br/>

**What Worked Well**

<div align="justify"> The choice of using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript as the technology stack proved to be effective. We were deciding between react or this, but in the end we chose HTML, CSS, and JavaScript as all of us are well versed on them. HTML provided a solid structure for the game's web page, while CSS allowed us to create an attractive and responsive design. JavaScript was the engine that drove the game, bringing it to life with interactivity and dynamic behavior. The development team's collaboration and dedication were also essential to the project's success. Regular team meetings, code reviews, and clear communication helped keep the development process on track. We had a team meet every monday where we discussed the things we needed to do that week and assigned works based on our strengths, we also discussed about our previous week's work. </div> 
<br/>

<div align="justify"> The diversity of game modes provided a great deal of replayability and catered to a wide range of players. Freeplay Mode allowed players to explore and learn at their own pace, while VS Mode introduced a competitive element. Countdown Mode and Sprint Mode challenged players to test their speed and memory skills. Customization features, such as grid size and timer settings, allowed players to tailor the game to their preferences. </div>  
<br/>

**What Didn't Work**

<div align="justify"> While the overall development process was successful, there were moments where we faced technical issues. The synchronization of timers across different game modes proved to be a complex task, and we encountered some unexpected bugs. Additionally, ensuring cross-browser compatibility required extra attention, as certain features behaved differently on various web browsers. </div>  
<br/>

**Lessons Learned**

<div align="justify"> Developing MemoRune Memory Game taught us several valuable lessons. Firstly, thorough testing and debugging are essential to identify and resolve issues promptly. Additionally, it's important to plan for compatibility across different web browsers from the early stages of development. Continuous communication within the development team is crucial for maintaining a cohesive and efficient workflow. </div>
<br/>

<div align="justify"> In conclusion, the design and development of MemoRune Memory Game was a rewarding experience. The blend of technology, creative design, and thoughtful game modes resulted in a captivating and educational memory challenge. The challenges we faced during development served as valuable learning experiences, ultimately leading to the successful creation of a game that we are proud to share with the world. </div>
